## Usage
This script can be used to gather information about GitHub topics and their corresponding repositories. It can serve as a tool for collecting and organizing data for analysis or reference.

## How it Works
The script starts by fetching the content of the GitHub Topics page using the requests library.
It then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content and extract specific elements like topic titles, descriptions, and repository URLs.
